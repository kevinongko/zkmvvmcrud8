### Features
* Used [Spring Java Configuration](https://dzone.com/articles/spring-java-config-101-0) (alternative to Spring XML Config)
* Used only (pure) ZK MVVM Style on CRUD transaction.
* Used Hibernate Validator Framework as the implementation of Java Bean Validation [JSR-303](http://beanvalidation.org/1.0/spec/).
* Used Hibernate [bidirectional association One-To-Many](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/manual/en-US/html/ch07.html) for Model.
* Browse list data have search feature that used `onChanging` or `onKeyPress` like event.
* Delete data have its popup confirmation.
* Applied [Template Pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm) into several generic class, in order to have a more clean code & scalability application.
* Used [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/) (experimental) for some `zul` components.


### Install & Run the Application
* Install [NetBeans IDE version 8.2](https://netbeans.org/downloads/), please ensure you also have installed its bundle __Apache Tomcat__ and activate __Maven__ feature. If you're advanced user, feel free to use any other IDE (_Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc_).
* Off course, you need to `git clone` this project into your local storage.
* Unless, you have been working with `maven` and have all the libraries that state above in your local cache. You need a __reliable internet connection__ on first attemp, in order to download all the dependencies. You can run `Build with Dependencies` on NetBeans.
* You dont need to install a database engine prior run the application. I used only a portable SQLite3 file, find it at this location: `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/zkmvvmcrud8.db`. You can use any compatible Database Editor to directly connect to that file. And feel free to explor.
* Usually, it has came with sample data. But If you would like, I also prepared the populate script for init data. Please find out at this classpath: `com.mkdika.zkmvvmcrud8.cli.PopulateInitData.class`. Just run this `driver class`.
* Finally, you can simply run this sample application with NetBeans `run` options.
